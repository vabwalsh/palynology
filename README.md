# palynology
This is a comparison between two sets of palynological data. Each was collected from the same samples, but by different researchers with different pollen counting methodologies and experience levels. This analysis was written in an attempt to determine trends in (dis)similarities in order to correct and adapt each researcher's counting. Additionally, it was able to help identify ways in which categories should be recombined, seeing as researcher A, for example, counted a category for "Indeterminate Conifer" pollen while researcher M did not.
